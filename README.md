 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

 # ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc.  
It uses machine learning models trained on real healthcare data to provide accurate predictions.
