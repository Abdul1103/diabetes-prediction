## 💡 About the Project
The Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning project aims to predict if a person is diabetic based on major medical diagnostic factors such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, age, and blood pressure. Early prediction enables timely medical action and better health management. The study uses supervised learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression, to categorize patients as diabetes or non-diabetic. The model was trained using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, a well-known dataset in the healthcare field.

This research shows how AI may be used in healthcare to help with early detection and awareness by merging Streamlit and Machine Learning.
